This project will explore on spring mvc architecture.

In order to setup the the system we need tomcat web server of compatible version.
Download the tomcat version from official site and extract it to specific location.

Go to Window -> Preference -> Server. 
Add Server and choose the parent folder of bin folder(upto bin). and apply the setting and close.

After that add the project to server so that servlet will run (.war) will deploy on the server.

Add the web project to server and run the server and hit the URL http://localhost:8080/SpringMvc<project-name>.

This should by default land on index.jsp page and should execute "Hello World!". So now web application is configured.

How Spring MVC works.??

First client will send the request -> that will be picked by web.xml and that will forward it to Dispatcher servlet (Front Controller).

Front-Controller again make use of configuration file and will delegate to specific controller depending on url-pattern.
